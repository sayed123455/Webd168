    <p>Hello! My name is Ali, and I am a beginner in web development and I am currently enrolled in WEBD168. I've always been fascinated by how websites work and enjoy creating things that people can interact with online.</p>
   <p>I enrolled in WEBD168 to build a solid foundation in web development. In today's digital world, understanding how to create and maintain websites is an invaluable skill, whether for professional development or personal projects. </p>
   <p>By the end of this semester I hope to learn and understand html and css fundamentals. I also hope to learn how to build accessible and standard complaint websites, and also develop problem solving skills. prior to this class I have only taken back end classes like c, c++ and java.</p>
